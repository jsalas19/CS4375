Introduction

For this warm-up exercise we were tasked with creating a simple chatbot with the following mapping.

    female --> How excellent! Are you a CS major?
    male --> Me too. Are you a CS major?
    no --> Too bad. Anyway, what's an animal you like, and you don't?
    yes --> Excellent, I am too. What's an animal you don't like, and two you do?
    [anything else] --> [last word] awesome, but I hate [first word] too. Bye for now.

That could be run in one of two modes either by standard user input via keyboard or a pre-written
user text file (.txt).

Approaches

At the start of this exercise I intended to use a switch case and ended up settling on a dictionary
that would provide a result in O(log(n)) rather than a O(n). This is because later down the line if and
when I wanted to add extra instructions to the reponse-set the look-up time would remain the same.
