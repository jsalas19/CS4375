1.  The CPU utilization should be 100% as we have queued a process to run right after 
    first was completed, and the program stopped as the process was completed, 
    which is an important behaviour mentioned in the readME. And I am correct as in the 
    examples given we add an 3 io-start which are added along with any other process.

2.  The CPU utilization should be 50% as we have two processes and only one is using the
    CPU while the other is running the IO so should be 10%. The actual result for the CPU
    were just as expected, but the IO utilization was 40% I believe this is due to the IO 
    staying ready/waiting until it hits the end of the programs runtime where it throws 
    an issue at the last record and counts it as an exit, thus making it a 4/5 rather
    than 5/5.

3.  This will only change the utilization and not the processes themselves, my assumption
    was correct about the utilization changing although I believed that the percentages 
    would have been swapped. In this case the CPU utilization was 83.33% and the IO utilization
    66.67%. I believe this is due to the IO remaining in a waiting state until an issue is
    raised 2/3's of the way into the program and the CPU stopping before the final iteration.

4.  The system performs exactly as it had before as it runs each process to completion and
    then switches to the next process.

5.  The system performs exactly as it had before but switches to the CPU process as it 
    was issued an IO, thus reducing the IO utilization.
